Just another tweeting python bot with hashtags inserting machine

It 
* reads choosen news feeds, 
* makes title parsing,
* sets keywords in titles by spoting NOUNs
* inserts hashtags afore keywords
* builds posts and tweets 'em
* waits for fresh news (used news links are packed in json) 

That's all.
